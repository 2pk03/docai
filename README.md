# Contextual PDF Search 

This scripta enable you to ask natural questions about PDF document(s) and get answers generated by a (S)LLM of your choice. It leverages the model's natural language processing capabilities to understand your queries and provide relevant information from the PDF, building a RAG and responds to natural questions.

## Features

* **Question-Answering:** Ask questions in natural language about the content of your PDF.
* **Hugging Face Integration:**  Leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library to access a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM models.
* **Sentence Embeddings:** Uses sentence embeddings to efficiently find the most relevant parts of the PDF to answer your questions.
* **Automatic Dependency Management:** Checks and installs required libraries to ensure a smooth setup.

## Requirements

* **Python 3.9 or higher:**  Please ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed.
* **Hugging Face Account:** You'll need a Hugging Face account to access their models. You can create one for free at [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/).
* **Libraries:**  The following Python libraries are required and will be installed automatically if not present:
    * `langchain`
    * `transformers`
    * `accelerate`
    * `bitsandbytes`
    * `sentence_transformers`

## Usage

1.  **Save the Script:** Download this script and save it as `pdf_qa.py`.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Although the script installs and updates all needed libraries, it sometimes fails to do so. In that case open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    ```
    python3 pdf_qa.py [model_id] [pdf_file_path]
    ```
    Replace `[model_id]` with the Hugging Face model ID you want to use (e.g., `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`). You can find a list of available models at [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models).
    Replace `[pdf_file_path]` with the path to your PDF file(s).

4.  **Ask Questions:**
    You'll be prompted to enter questions. Type your questions in natural language and press Enter. The script will provide answers based on the content of the PDF.

5.  **Exit:**
    Type `exit` and press Enter to quit the script.
